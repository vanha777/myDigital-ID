	<h1>About me</h1>

	<h3>Journey</h3>
	<p>
		As a passionate and self-motivated developer based in Australia, I have
		taken an unconventional path towards my career in technology. From my
		beginnings as a mechanic, I have since transitioned into the tech
		industry, learning to code in my spare time and building applications as
		a hobby. Through this journey, I have developed a deep appreciation for
		the power of technology and its ability to change the world.
	</p>

	<h3 class="my-5">Personality</h3>
	<p>
		One of my core values is honesty and transparency. I strive to approach
		every project and task with integrity, keeping all stakeholders informed
		and involved throughout the process. This allows for open communication
		and fosters trust, both essential for successful partnerships.
	</p>

	<h3>Mindset</h3>
	<p>
		In addition to my technical skills, I am constantly developing my
		entrepreneurial mindset. I invest and trade in cryptocurrency and am an
		admirer of blockchain technology, having deployed, written, and
		interacted with smart contracts on both the Ethereum and Cardano
		blockchains. I also maintain a coding diary through blogging,
		documenting my growth and experiences as a developer.
	</p>

	<h3>Ability</h3>
	<p>
		As a hands-on learner, I thrive in an environment where I can experiment
		with new ideas and technologies. I am adaptive and fast-forward
		thinking, constantly exploring new possibilities and developing
		innovative solutions. As an aspiring entrepreneur, I am always looking
		for opportunities to create value and make a positive impact in the
		world.
